1. How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
First we will use below codeï¼š
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Then I will below to create TCP- socket :
bind()
listen()
accept()
connect()
send()
recv()

Smmary of use:
For server: bind(), listen() and accept()
For client: connect()
Both: send() and recv()

2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
The main difference is how the connection is created

Client: connect() to a listen() server. The client initiates connections. Request a data.

Server: bind(), listen(), accept() and connect() from a client. Received a data.

3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?

First we use below code to create s:
with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:

Then I use the below to reuse the same bind port:
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

        

4: What information do we get about incoming connections?

We need conn and address. where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on the connection, 
and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection

5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?

Receive data from the socket. The return value is a bytes object representing the data received.

6: Provide a link to your code on GitHub.
